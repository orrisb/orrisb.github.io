<b>Rare bureaucrat discovered</b>
<br>Bureaucrats and other public &#39;servants&#39; normally have all traces of common 
sense and compassion surgically removed. However, we have found a bureaucrat who 
escaped this career requirement. He was discovered when he actually made a 
sensible decision, much to the surprise of the electorate. DNA tests also showed 
that the gene commonly found in control freaks was absent in this man; the 
control freak gene is usually present in bureaucrats and jobsworths of all 
nationalities.</p><!-- close paragraphl-->
