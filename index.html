                <h2>Which browser should we design for?</h2>
                <strong>The answer is all of them.</strong> If you survey a group of computer 
                aficionados you will get very different answers compared with the general 
                publicâ€™s answers.&nbsp; 
                I worked as a freelance computer technician for over eleven years, During that 
                period 
                I never came across a single person who was using a browser other than <mark>Internet Explorer</mark>. 
                <aside>
                The great majority of ordinary folk are using <mark>IE</mark> because it came pre-installed with their computers. 
                </aside>
                None had ever heard of Mozilla Firefox, although I did meet one person whose son had put Firefox on his computer, 
                he wanted me to remove it because he did not know what it was. 
                The great majority of ordinary folk are using <mark>IE</mark> because it came pre-installed 
                with their computers. When reading magazine surveys, it would be safer to increase their survey figures for <mark>Internet Explorer.</mark> 
                The result show that you should ensure that your websites work in <mark>IE7</mark> and <mark>IE8</mark> because these 
                are the most used (by default). It would be safe to predict that there will be a strong swing 
                towards <mark>IE 9</mark> from 2011.
